## how computer work 
### the computer work under rules so every action happen in computer it given by order if you right a code you will give the computer a list of order to procces it and it may contain an input to procces it or it may be action to do it 
### when you use the computer you have to give it a right instructor to do it becouse the computer will do the exact thig that you dive so if you give the computer the wrong order it will do it without any correction becouse this is how computer work
